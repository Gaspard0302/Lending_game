# Lending Game for X-HEC DSAIB class of Finance 

## Project realised for Professor Hombert of HEC Paris Department of Finance.

Team members:

- RaphaÃ«l Amzallag
- Alexander Bohane
- Tess Coullon
- Gaspard Hassenforder
- Henri Vignial

## Goal

Predict the probability of default for 100,000 loan applicants and decide which applicants are granted loans and at which interest rate. The goal is to maximize the profit made from the interest once the loan is repaid, assuming there is no default. The results are compared with other groups representing the rest of the market. Our team is competing for market share with other teams in the class; the aim is to offer interest rates low enough to gain clients while also maximizing profit.
