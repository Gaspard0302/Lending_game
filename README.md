## Goal

Predict the probability of default of 100,000 loan applicants and decide to which applicants loans are granted and at which interest rate. The goal is to maximize the profit made thanks to the interests once the loan is repayed - if there is no default of payment. The results are compared with other groups representing the rest of the market.
